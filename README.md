# rcmpy
This is a wrapper around my [rcm](https://github.com/173duprot/rcm) library.

This is a tiny elegant rust program that takes advantage of extremely compact functional syntax to remove C-like comments with very specifically defined behavior. Replacing the comment text with spaces, and leaving in newlines. It supports C, C++, C#, and Java.

## Usage
```sh
#
# install rust    on your system
# install python  on your system
# install pip     on your system
# install maturin on your system using pip
#
# read the pyo3 guide: https://pyo3.rs/v0.15.1/
#
# AND
#
# read example.sh
#
# to understand how this works
#

chmod +x example.sh
./example.sh
```
