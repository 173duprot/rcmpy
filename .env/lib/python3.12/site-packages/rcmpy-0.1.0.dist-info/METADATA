# rcmpy
This is a wrapper around my [rcm](https://github.com/173duprot/rcm) library.

This is a tiny elegant rust program that takes advantage of extremely compact functional syntax to remove C-like comments with very specifically defined behavior. Replacing the comment text with spaces, and leaving in newlines. It supports C, C++, C#, and Java.

## Usage
```sh
# install rust    on your system
# install python  on your system
# install pip     on your system
# install maturin on your system using pip

# read example.sh to understand how this works

chmod +x example.sh
./example.sh
```
